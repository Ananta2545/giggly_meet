# 🤪 Giggly_Meet — My First Ever Next.js Project 🎉

Welcome to **Giggly_Meet**, the fun and slightly weird cousin of Google Meet that nobody asked for... but here we are 😎  
This is my **first-ever project in Next.js**, and boy, it's been a wild ride! I made this giggle-fueled clone of Google Meet just to flex my frontend muscles and dive deep into video calling apps 🚀

---

## 🌐 What is Giggly_Meet?

Giggly_Meet is a **video calling platform** inspired by Google Meet but with way more personality!  
It’s built using **Next.js** for the frontend and **ZegoCloud** for real-time video call functionality.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **Next.js** — First time using it, and I’m loving the hybrid power of SSR + SPA.
- 🧠 **React** — Of course, it's the brains of the operation.
- 🧪 **Tailwind CSS** — For those sweet utility-first styles.
- 📞 **ZegoCloud SDK** — For seamless and stable video calling.
- 🌩️ **Toastify** — For juicy little toasts that give feedback.
- 🔐 **next-auth** — For authentication (coming soon: full login flow).
- 🍭 **Lucide Icons** — Because who doesn't like a bit of icon flair?

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to setup and use **Next.js** (my first time! 🎉).
- Leveraging **ZegoCloud SDK** to create real-time, peer-to-peer video call rooms.
- Using **UUIDs** to generate unique room links.
- Managing state, effects, and UI transitions like a pro.
- Implementing **dialog modals** and **dropdown menus** with style.
- Clipboard access and toast notifications for interactivity.
- Styling with **Tailwind CSS** (and avoiding too many headaches).
- Routing and navigation using `useRouter` from Next.js.
- Conditional rendering and clean component structure.

## ⚠️ A Word of Caution

This project currently runs on **ZegoCloud's free trial**, which means:

⏳ **Only 10,000 free minutes** of video calling are available.  
After that... well, things might stop working 😅  
(Unless I sell a kidney and buy a subscription, but let’s not go there.)

So enjoy the video calls while they last! 🕺

---

## 🚧 What's Next?

- ✅ Authentication with `next-auth`
- ✅ UI enhancements with animation and transitions
- 🔜 Chat during calls (because what's a call without awkward texts?)
- 🔜 Screen sharing (so we can *really* pretend we’re in a meeting)

---

## 🙌 Special Thanks

- **ZegoCloud** for the generous free trial.
- The amazing dev community for being my StackOverflow at 2 AM.
- Coffee, bugs, and console logs — couldn’t have done it without you.
